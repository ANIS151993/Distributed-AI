# Overleaf Upload Package

This folder is upload-ready for Overleaf.

## Included

- `IEEE_Distributed_AI_Ensemble.tex`
- `references.bib`
- `figures/` (all PNG assets used in the paper)
- `tables/` (all LaTeX tables generated from benchmark artifacts)

## Overleaf Steps

1. Create a new Overleaf project.
2. Upload all files and folders from this directory.
3. Set main file to `IEEE_Distributed_AI_Ensemble.tex`.
4. Compile with PDFLaTeX + BibTeX.

## Notes

- Table and figure assets are already generated from repository artifacts.
- If metrics are rerun, regenerate tables/figures first, then refresh this package.
