# Overleaf Support Package

This folder now contains the supporting Overleaf assets plus the encrypted manuscript package.

## Included

- `IEEE_Distributed_AI_Ensemble_Protected.tar.gpg`
- `PAPER_ACCESS_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
- `references.bib`
- `figures/` (all PNG assets used in the paper)
- `tables/` (all LaTeX tables generated from benchmark artifacts)

## Public Access Note

The plain manuscript files are intentionally not published in this public branch.
Authorized users must decrypt the protected package first, then upload the extracted files to Overleaf privately.

## Notes

- Table and figure assets are already generated from repository artifacts.
- If metrics are rerun, regenerate tables/figures first, then refresh this package.
